# Front End Techdegree Project 6 

In this project, I had to create a browser version of "Wheel of Success", a word guessing game where players click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase. 

Using Javascipt, I had to create an array of phrases and write functions to choose a random phrase from that array, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the game board. 

For each guess a player makes, I added programming to compare the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, I added programming to update the game board with the chosen letters. 

A player can keep choosing letters until they have five incorrect guesses. If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display. 

A player can guess a letter only once. After they've guessed a letter, the letter is disabled. 

I also went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to: 

  1. Create CSS transitions for each letter in the phrase display as they are revealed. 
  2. Add a button to the "success" and "failure" screens that resets the game. I had to create the buttons for the keyboard, generate a new random phrase, and set the number of misses to zero. 

  Browsers tested for compatility: 

  1. Chrome
  2. Firefox
  3. Edge
